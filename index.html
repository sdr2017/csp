					There are many ways to define "living well," 
					but we think one of the best is being able to choose the life you want to live, 
					to share what you believe to be true, 
					and to have things you find beautiful. 
					Perhaps you agree. 

					It's why many years ago, we came home to Kansas, 
					gathered together objects we loved,
					and opened a general store called C.S. Post & Co.<br><br>

					We believed – and still do believe – that people want to 
					fill their homes with things that bring beauty, warmth and pleasure to each day – 
					fresh flowers, linen cocktail napkins, a charming vintage table, or a lamp that's frankly modern.
					Beautiful spaces are not about one style, but about passion and personality. <br><br>

					Since that time, the world has changed, and
					C.S. Post & Co. has closed its first chapter 
					at our original location in downtown Hays.
					We hope we were able to help you find unique treasures 
					that make your home special, and we hope to meet again soon.
